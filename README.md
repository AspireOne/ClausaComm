## What is ClausaComm?
ClausaComm is a LAN chatting app. You can connect to other computers in the same network and communicate with them. The idea and functionality is similar to any other chatting app, like Skype (or more advanced Discord), except that this one is LAN-based.

## Why?
This project initially started when I saw a hole in the market of LAN chatting and calling programs. The main idea was that with LAN calling, there would be practically no delay, and that comes in handy in fast-paced multiplayer games. I was also curious as to how networking is solved in chatting programs. And so I set myself to the challenge of creating one from scratch.

My guess was that it would take me just about two weeks, but not too soon it turned out that there is far more complexity involved.
